Design Pattern Type:
    Creational Patterns: Deal with object creation mechanisms (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype).

    Structural Patterns: Deal with object composition and relationships (e.g., Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy).

 Singleton : (Single Responsibility Principle : SRP)
    Only one instance of a class is created.
    Global access to that instance is provided.   

 Factory : (Open/Closed Principle: OCP)
    Instead of calling a constructor directly to create an object, you use a factory method that decides which class to instantiate.
    When the code needs to create objects based on conditions, without hard-coding class names everywhere.

Adapter :  All   
    It allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by converting one interface into another expected by the client.
    When there are third party module
